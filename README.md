## Weclome


It's a priviledge to welcome you to Angular 2 class!

The class is exercise driven, so it's worth having a glance over the below to learn how to run the exercises.

## Structure

```sh
# here are the slides, in HTML format, yours to take home and enjoy! simply open slides/index.html in your favourite brower
./slides 

# whenever we're working on an exercise together, I'll point you to the exercises folder
./exercises

# we'll be building an app today, this is where you'll be writing most of your code
./app
```

## Exercises

The exercises are split into steps in `./exercises`.

Here are our goals in the exercises today. They're intended to be chances to use what you've learned, not puzzles. If it's not clear what to do, ask me!

All Angular 2 work should be written in `./app.`

Run `npm start` to:

1. compile your code in `/app` on change
1. open a browser to a live-reloading page
1. if you don't see what you expect, right click and click 'Inspect'. Then open the console tab
