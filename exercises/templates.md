# Templates

## Steps

1. use this ([cheatsheet](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cheatsheet.html)) for reference - there's lots of syntax!


### Displaying data

1. we want to display some data in our template
1. define a `title` property for your `App` component
1. initialize a string property with a name of your choice
1. use the interpolation syntax to display it in the template 
1. also try out the interpolation syntax out with the `title=` attribute of an element. Hover over it to see the browser title popup - does the interpolation work?

### Styling and changing attributes

1. we want to use Angular to change the color of an element, controlled by a property
1. define a property holding an HTML colour string
1. use the attribute syntax to bind that to the `color` style attribute of an element in your `App` template

### Responding to user input

1. we want to define a purchase button, and count items purchases
1. define a simple model track quantity the user wishes to buy
  1. define a `purchase` method for `App`
  1. add a quantity property to `App`, initialized to 0
  1. make the purchase method increment `quantity`
1. show the user the quantity
  1. using the interpolation syntax, display the user the quantity they've bought
1. define some UI to allow user to buy
  1. add a `<button>` to your `App` template
  1. listen to click events on the button, first the `purchase` event
